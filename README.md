#The Iceland API Challenge

###Instructions

Clone the repo.

You must examine the [Iceland API](http://docs.apis.is/) documentation and use the skills you've learned up to this point with promises and with string/number/array/object manipulation to answer the questions in the `index.html` file, making asynchronous requests to the Iceland API. 

To start the project, you will have to set up the `<script>` tags to load both jQuery and the `main.js` file.  jQuery is recommended for making requests to the iceland-api with `$.getJSON`

Submit your answer in the html-elements with the appropriate `div` tags
